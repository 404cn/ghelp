#+TITLE: ghelp

This package provides a generic help system similar to Emacs Help. Unlike Emacs Help, ghelp works for more major-modes and is extensible with backends.

Currently supported backends:
- [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]]
- [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]

* Install & load

Download the files and add them to load path.

With ~use-package~:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ghelp
  :config (ghelp-global-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC
Without ~use-package~:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ghelp)
(ghelp-global-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Currently you can bind ~ghelp-describe-symbol~ and ~ghelp-describe-at-point~ to a keybinding you like, or bind ~ghelp-map~.

* In ghelp buffer
A ghelp buffet is called a page. Each page is made of several entries. Each entry is a self-contained documentation. (For example, you could have a entry for a symbol as a function and another one for it as a variable.)

Commands you can use:

| Key           | Command                        |
|---------------+--------------------------------|
| =f/b=         | go forward/backward in history |
| =n/p=         | next/previous entry            |
| =m/[=         | next/previous button           |
| =TAB=         | collapse/expand entry          |
| =g=           | refresh page                   |
| =q=           | close page                     |
| =<space>=     | scroll down                    |
| =<backspace>= | scroll up                      |
| =s=           | search/switch to a page        |

* Customization
If you want several major modes to share the same set of history and backends (like ~lisp-interaction-mode~ and ~emacs-lisp-mode~), add an entry ~(mode1 . mode2)~ to ~ghelp-mode-share-alist~, and ~mode1~ will share everything of ~mode2~.

You can customize faces: ~ghelp-entry~, ~ghelp-folded-entry~, and ~ghelp-entry-title~.

Normally if you call ~ghelp-describe-function~ it selects the backends to use by the current major-mode. If you want to look up some symbol with a specific backend, try ~(ghelp-describe-as-in 'mode)~. This function returns a modified ~ghelp-describe-function~ that selects backends by ~mode~. For example, you can bind
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key (kbd "C-h C-e") (ghelp-describe-as-in ’emacs-lisp-mode))
#+END_SRC
to look up Emacs symbols regardless of which major mode you are currently in.

* Write a backend
Each backend is essentially two functions: one returns a list of symbols it knows (or return nil if it can’t), the other returns a list of entries, given informations like symbol or point.

One you have your functions, you can use ~ghelp-register-backend~ to register your backend to a major mode.
