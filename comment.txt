* Usage

Use these functions:

- ‘ghelp-describe-symbol’
- ‘ghelp-describe-at-point’

* Terminology

- ghelp   :: this package

- page    :: the buffer displaying documentation

- backend :: the backend providing documentation

- entry   :: page is made of entries. Each entry is a self-contained
             documentation for the symbol. Each symbol can be
             interpreted in different ways and we present each
             interpretation’s documentation in a entry.

- history :: Each major-mode has it’s own page history

* Page anatomy

    <entry>
    <newline>
    <entry>
    <newline>
    ...

* Entry anatomy

    <title>
    <text>

* Backends

Each backend is essentially two functions: symbol-list and
describe-symbol. ‘symbol-list’ returns a list of symbols and
‘describe-symbol’, given symbol, buffer and point information, returns
a list of entries to be displayed. Read the docsting of
‘ghelp-sync-backend’ for more information.

* History

‘ghelp-history’ is specialized for ghelp:

 1. new nodes are always added to the end of the history
 2. when looking for a particular node, you can optionally
    move that node to the end of the history. See
    ‘ghelp-history--find-and-move’.

* Code structure

ghelp is made of several parts: ghelp-describe, ghelp-history,
ghelp-page, ghelp-entry, ghelp-backend. They don’t know the detail of
each other and only communicate by “exposed” functions. You can find
the “exposed” functions on the beginning of each section.
